# PokÃ©mon Retrieval-Augmented Generation QA System ðŸ”¥ Powered by RAGAS

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Question-Answering (QA) system using the PokÃ©API. The application accepts PokÃ©mon-related questions, retrieves answers from the PokÃ©API, generates natural-language responses using a language model, and evaluates the results using **RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment)** metrics for comprehensive evaluation of answer relevancy, faithfulness, correctness, and similarity.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokemon-rag-qa.git
   cd pokemon-rag-qa
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   
   Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the necessary API keys and configuration settings:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   
   Execute the Flask web application:
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```
   
   Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Features

### ðŸ”¥ RAGAS Integration
This application now uses **RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment)** for comprehensive evaluation:

- **Answer Relevancy**: Measures how well the answer addresses the question
- **Faithfulness**: Evaluates if the answer is grounded in the provided context
- **Answer Correctness**: Assesses the factual accuracy of the response
- **Answer Similarity**: Compares semantic similarity between responses

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Web Interface
- Real-time Pokemon question answering
- RAGAS evaluation scores displayed for each response
- Variety testing with multiple response generation
- Multiple personality modes (factual, friendly, expert, casual)

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Evaluation
- Single answer evaluation with RAGAS metrics
- Variety analysis for response diversity
- Fallback scoring when RAGAS evaluation fails
- Detailed scoring breakdown for transparency

## Usage

### Web Interface
1. Start the Flask application: `python src/app.py`
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Ask Pokemon-related questions in the chat interface
4. View RAGAS evaluation scores for each response
5. Test response variety with the "Variety Test" feature

### Demo Script
Run the RAGAS integration demo:
```bash
python demo_ragas.py
```

## Example Questions

- "What type is Charizard?"
- "How much does Pikachu weigh?"
- "What are Bulbasaur's abilities?"
- "What moves can Squirtle learn?"

## RAGAS Evaluation Metrics

The system evaluates responses using these RAGAS metrics:

- **Factual Accuracy**: Based on answer_correctness and faithfulness
- **Response Quality**: Based on answer_relevancy  
- **Engagement**: Derived from response characteristics
- **Similarity**: Using answer_similarity for variety testing
- **Overall Score**: Weighted combination of all metrics

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:
- `ragas`: For RAG evaluation metrics
- `flask`: Web framework
- `openai`: For language model integration
- `requests`: For PokÃ©API calls
- `datasets`: For RAGAS dataset creation
